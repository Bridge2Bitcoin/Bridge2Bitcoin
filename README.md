# Bridge 2 Bitcoin - Volunteer Guide. 

#### Below is a list of options and ideas for onboarding merchants.

## Merchant Options 

### Option 1 - [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) or [Muun Wallet](https://muun.com/)

Suitable for:

**Small businesses with 1-2 employees that want to hold Bitcoin or can transfer to fiat themselves using an exchange.** 

Get them to download the wallet app by visiting their app store, or by using the 'Bitcoin for Businesses' leaflet QR code. Help them to change the default currency to GBP. Tell them about the email/backup process (in WoS). Show them how to use it and send them 100 sats as a demo.

Give them a few 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' stickers and tell them about the merchant benefits listed below in the final section.

Add them to the BTCMap and ask Simon or James to add them to the 'Where To Spend' map at BitcoinEvents.UK.

See [The Ultimate Option 1 setup](https://github.com/Hodl-Solo/Bridge2Bitcoin-Volunteers/blob/main/Option1Ultimatesetup.md) for some additional steps.

#### Advantages

- Quick to get setup and very easy to use.
- Handles onchain and lightning balance as one which keeps things simple.
- Provides a reusable LNURL address that can be printed out and used. Good option for some merchants e.g one-man food truck.

#### Disadvantages

- Custodial.
- No PoS mode yet (it is being worked on though for Wallet of Satoshi).

### Option 2 - [LNbits](https://lnbits.com/)/[LNPoS](https://github.com/lnbits/LNPoS)

Suitable for

**Small businesses with 2+ employees that would like a dedicated device-based Point of Sale (LNPoS) and as with option 1 are happy to convert to fiat themselves or better still hold the Bitcoin.

This option is so far the least popular as option 1 or 3 seems to cover most businesses. It can also sound the most complicated to a small business and involves the most amount of setup and admin on our side.

Despite the moderate complexity in setup, it does offer some advantages to the merchants and is easy to manage once set up.

#### Advantages

- An optional hardware PoS (LNPoS) that only costs approx £40.
- Onchain payments will go directly into a wallet the merchant controls.
- The LNPoS needs no internet connection, it relies on the customer's phone connection to send the transaction.
- The LNPoS has an ATM function that allows the merchant to sell Bitcoin for fiat.
- TPoS is an LNbits extension that allows a 'receive only' Point of sale to be quickly accessed by any member of staff via a QR code on their own phone.
- Lower fees when using lightning than option 3.
- Non-custodial/self sovereign option

#### Disadvantages

- Technically more difficult to setup

If a merchant goes with this option they will need assistance setting up from Simon to access our LNbits instance.

### Option 3 - [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)

**Any business from 1 to 1000 employees.

The most popular choice and one that allows the use of BoltCards.

#### Advantages

- BoltCard use
- CoinCorner will send 10 free bolt cards to the merchant after signup. These can be sold or given away for free by the merchant.
- The merchant can choose not to hold the Bitcoin and instead have it flipped to pounds as it arrives in their account.

#### Disadvantages

- 1% fee on transactions
- Signing up for the CoinCorner merchant account can be a trial for some merchants especially those with partners and/or limited companies.

## Merchant Benefits

- Accepting bitcoin for payments opens up a whole new customer base for each business that joins the network. Bitcoiners that otherwise wouldn’t have known about them will visit and pay with bitcoin.
- Bitcoiners love supporting local businesses that are joining the bitcoin network.
- The business will be added to the merchant map at [BitcoinEvents.UK](https://bitcoinevents.uk/spending/) and added to the [BTCMap.org](https://btcmap.org/) project providing great visibility to the bitcoin community.
- If they are the first Bitcoin business in their area or first pub, hairdresser or butcher, for example, the local newspapers may run a story on them, creating more buzz for their business.
- All the benefits of using permissionless, uncensorable money that central banks and self-interested governments can't inflate away.
