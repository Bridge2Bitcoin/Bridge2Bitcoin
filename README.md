# What is the Bridge 2 Bitcoin Wiki?

The Bridge 2 Bitcoin Wiki is a project that allows the Bitcoin community to collaborate, via GitHub's wiki feature on a worldwide merchant adoption guide. 

The wiki can then be used by anyone, wanting to help businesses start accepting Bitcoin as payment.

Every country around the world has different Bitcoin services available to them. We'd like people from as many countries as possible to create guides for working techniques in their respective countries. 

# How does the Bridge 2 Bitcoin Wiki work?

If you'd like to contribute, join the [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/xUUHvZnDkc) and find out how.

# Who uses the Bridge 2 Bitcoin Wiki?

Anyone that has a business or knows of a business that wants to accept Bitcoin as payment. 

All Bitcoiners around the world that have had success onboarding merchants can now share their playbook with the rest of us. 

Similarly those with little experience but a willingness to give it a go can learn some tried and tested techniques to apply to their local area. 

# What is the Bridge 2 Bitcoin Wiki goal?

Nothing short of hyperbitcoinization.
