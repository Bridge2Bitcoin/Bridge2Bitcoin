## V 0.3

# **Merchant Setup** \- Swiss Bitcoin Pay and Wallet of Satoshi.
This is a guide written for our volunteers to use to help them when onboarding businesses. 

**Note \- The merchants must have a phone and a laptop ready to complete these steps.**

## 1\. Download Wallet of Satoshi.

Before setting up Swiss Bitcoin Pay, the company owner or the person ultimately in control of the funds must have a lightning wallet that provides a lightning address as the destination.

Wallets that can be used include:

* Wallet of Satoshi  
* Blink  
* Strike

In this guide, we will use **Wallet of Satoshi** as it is the easiest to use.

### 1.1 Change to GBP in WoS.

Wallet of Satoshi will display the fiat balance in USD by default. Change this to GBP via the menu in the top right corner.

### 1.2 Login/register with WoS.

* From the menu, click the red section.   
* They then need to enter their email address and make sure it’s one they have access to right now. (make sure they don’t close the next prompt by clicking ‘Cancel’, leave it open while they check their email, or they’ll have to repeat the process)  
* Copy and paste the two words they receive in their email to the text box in the app.  
* The red box should now turn green and they are good to go.

### 1.3 Warn that WoS is custodial.

It should only be used to collect sats, and once they have built up to a certain amount, say £500–600 (at least 1M sats), they should transfer the funds onchain to a hardware wallet.

### 1.4 Send them some sats (a small amount).

They will need to pay a 1 sat invoice in a later step so send them a few sats. 21 seems a good number.

## 2\. Swiss Bitcoin Pay

**Explain the fees.**  
SBP charge 0.21% on bitcoin transactions for the first year and then just 1% afterwards. It is important to note that this is just on bitcoin transactions, this doesn’t affect their existing fiat payment system.

Send them the Bridge 2 Bitcoin referral link\* so they can open it on their laptop.

[https://swiss-bitcoin-pay.ch/?refCode=BRIDGE2BITCOIN](https://swiss-bitcoin-pay.ch/?refCode=BRIDGE2BITCOIN)

Or send them your own if you have one.

\*Swiss Bitcoin Pay will pay you or us, a small percentage of the 0.21% fee they charge. So for example, if a customer comes in and spends £20 SBP get 4p (currently 48 sats) and whoever has onboarded them and uses their referral code receives a small percentage of the 48 sats. So obviously we do this to spread bitcoin adoption not to get rich. 

### 2.1. Fill out the SBP form.

### 2.2. Make sure they enter their WoS lightning address on setup.

* Guide them if necessary to pay the 1 sat invoice with their Wallet of Satoshi app.

### 2.3. Click submit when complete.

### 2.4. Go to their email for SBP welcome email.

* Do this on the laptop.

## 3\. Get them to download the SBP app on their phone.

* Note \- At some point explain that SBP is not a wallet app it’s just a routing and invoicing app.

### 3.1. Connect the phone app to the SBP account via QR on the dashboard.

* Do this by scanning the dashboard QR code with the SBP app.

### 3.2. Change the default device name to their name.

* If this is not done and two devices have the same name i.e. ‘iPhone’ it confuses SBP and payments will not go through.

</div>

### 3.3. Get them to generate a 1p invoice in the SBP app.

* Pay it for them.

### 3.4. Check they now have the sats in WoS and it shows on the SBP dashboard.

### 3.5. Explain linking staff phones to the SBP app.

* They can link any number of staff SBP PoS apps to the account. They can only receive funds, so it is safe and recommended for all staff to have it set up on their phones.  
* This eliminates the “We can’t take bitcoin today the boss isn’t here” situation.

### 3.6. Explain the invoicing features of SBP if necessary.

### 3.7. Explain API if necessary.
